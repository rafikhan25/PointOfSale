# PointOfSale
Store UI and Inventory with functions, built with the Scala programming language.

This is a project I coded in my sophomore year as a Computer Science major at the SUNY University at Buffalo using Scala, an object-oriented
programming language.

My work consists of all of the files found in PointOfSale/src/store/model and the files in PointOfSale/src/tests. Other files were provided by the instructor.
